# GL45_3D
a repository for the 3d files for a gl45 cap with ports

The project was made to allow for cheaper GL45 cap with ports. It still require a normal cap to seal it but those are more readily available.
The tubes were made thicker to be compatible with basic PLA printers. It is recommended to overextrude (10% or more) + printing a reduced speed to ensure better quality parts as normal printing would make for a porous non-airtight plastic
A resin printer is ideal to ensure good air tightness.

The project was made with with freecad. 
Different port layout or other file format can be asked on demand.
