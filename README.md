A repository for the 3d files for a gl45 cap with ports

The project was made to allow for cheaper GL45 cap with ports. It still require a normal cap to seal it but those are more readily available.
The tubes were made thicker to be compatible with basic PLA printers. It is recommended to overextrude (10% or more) + printing a reduced speed to ensure better quality parts as normal printing would make for a porous non-airtight plastic.  
A resin printer is ideal to ensure good air tightness.

The project was made with with freecad (.FCStd).  
The .stl file can be used directly with your Slicing software.
Different port layout or other file format can be asked on demand.
